<!-- # Hi there üëã -->

## Current status

In reverse chronological order:
* Starting January 2025: **Head of DevOps & IT** at **[Market Pay](https://market-pay.com)**, a European FinTech / Payment Solution Provider.
* From May 2024 to December 2024: **Engineering Manager DevOps** at **[Descartes Underwriting](http://descartesunderwriting.com)**, a new generation of insurance that builds resilience against climate, cyber and other emerging risks.
* From December 2023 to March 2024: I was **Site Reliability Engineering Manager** at **[Algolia](https://algolia.com)**, the world‚Äôs only end-to-end AI search and discovery platform.
* From September 2022 to May 2023 I was **Principal Infrastructure Engineer** at **[Dfns](https://dfns.co)**, provider of Crypto Wallets as an API.
* From May 2021 to July 2022 I was the **Head of SRE** at **[GitGuardian](https://gitguardian.com)**, a cybersecurity company.
<!-- * From January to March 2021 I was the **Head of SRE** at **[Qonto](https://qonto.com)**, managing 3 teams (Platform SRE, App SRE, Internal IT). -->
* From 2017 to September 2020 I was the [Head of Infrastructure](https://linkedin.com/in/ffarid) at **[Kapten](https://kapten.com)** a leading French, and now European, ride-hailing company üöó
  By the way you can find Kapten's public GitHub organisation [here](https://github.com/ChauffeurPrive).
  As Kapten's mother company, Free Now, had decided to layoff the whole French Tech & Product teams in 2020 instead, I started looking for a new job in May 2020 üò±
  On top of this, due to the COVID-19 üò∑ crisis, our whole company had been working remotely for more than three months and my SRE/IT team had globally
  less work to do. I decided to make a profit of this free time and to improve my Cloud, coding & algorithmics skills, hence these trainings.

## Current focus

After spending time on Kubernetes, Helm and ArgoCD, I have paused training for now.

You'll find below the list of my personal repositories on
which I have written code. My main centers of interest today are the following (this may of course change over time):

* **AI/ML**
  * [**In Progress** üöß] **[Data Science et Machine Learning | MasterClass Python](https://www.udemy.com/share/105tQq3@R2hBdpsT0v_A2trjUvFObPp7Gz62oJjlOJRj7IrBuQJoxTyjxn9fOaA6gvl46GuLNw==/)**.

  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] **[Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=2301254)**.
* **Rust**
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I first used **[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** to teach myself Rust. Here is my training code: https://github.com/Farzy/rust-training
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I practiced some more using the **Rustling** project: https://github.com/Farzy/rustlings
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] I'm now practing mostly using **[Exercism.io](https://exercism.io)**, here is my code: https://github.com/Farzy/Exercism-rust
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] I also started playing with **[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)** in Rust (and some Python 3): https://github.com/Farzy/CodinGame
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I finished this excellent training, **[Learn Rust by Building Real Applications](https://www.udemy.com/share/103oAW3@oZ2Qxtk71d0EmOaROGdmHEoVIfjrT9QotclhvbnKHtm-JHoCgjadTviKefa_PM1Z2A==/)** on Udemy in September 2023. Here is my code: https://github.com/Farzy/rust-fundamentals
* **Blockchain**
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I did the **[Brilliant Cryptocurrency](https://brilliant.org/courses/cryptocurrency/)** course. 
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] Now I'm following the **[Blockchain A-Z‚Ñ¢: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/)** tutorial on Udemy, the sample code is here: https://github.com/Farzy/blockchain-az.
* **Python 3**
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I started on the **[Python 3.8 tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html)** of course: https://github.com/Farzy/python3-training
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I tried **[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)** but I didn't really like the book‚Ä¶: https://github.com/Farzy/lpthw
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I practised the whole **[30 days of code in Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy)** on HackerRank: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/30-days-of-code
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I also did all the 115 Python exercises on **HackerRank**: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/python.
* **Algorithmics**
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] I'm currently training on the [Algorithmics / Problem solving course](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy) on **HackerRank**. I have answered around 30 problems: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/algorithms.
* **Mathematics**
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] I used to love maths, but then lost interest. Now I want to practise again, so I started training on **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)**! I just hastily solved the first 2 problems and saw that if I took some more time, plus a pencil and a piece of paper, I could have found more elegant algorithms: https://github.com/Farzy/project-euler. I'm trying to use **Rust** for all problems üòä
* **Statistics**
  * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I did the **10 days of statistic** on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy) in Rust, execept for one very complex exercice that I solved using Python 3 and NumPy / SciPy üòÖ https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/statistics.
* **Cryptography**
  * [**Paused** ‚è∏Ô∏è] I started the **[Cryptopals challenge](https://cryptopals.com)** for fun coding in Rust, to learn more about cryptography and to discover how cryptography can be broken: https://github.com/Farzy/cryptopals.
* **X86-64 Assembly**
  * [*Done* ‚úÖ] I started learning the basics of x86-64 assembly because‚Ä¶ why not? I didn't go very far, just enough to know that I'm not fond of low-level development: https://github.com/Farzy/fant-asm. It was also an excuse for writing some small helper scripts in Rust.
